      <h1>The Feminist's Library Card</h1>

      <h2>Desired Goal For Project</h2>
      <p>Based off of Emma Watson's book club, I want to create a platform where
        the progressive community can come together and share literature that
         concentrates on feminist issues of today. I want people to connect with
         one another and start a conversation about gaining new perspectives on
         social justic issues. Visitors of the site can post book reviews, interviews
         with authors, and blog about events in the literary community. Social media can be
         accessed through this website and there could also be article and photo
         essays uploaded on the blog twice a week.

      <h2>Why this Pitch?</h2>
      <p>I am interested in social justice issues, and while there are feminist
        literary magazines, they often are ran by editors who are subjective and
        focus more on gaining readers and publishing writers. On this website,
        I want there to be more of an interaction between writers and readers,
        or even people who want to learn more about social justice issues.

      <h2>Sub-tasks that Make Up the Project</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Creating a Home Page with an organized menu</li>
        <li>Creating a fake Blog Page</li>
        <li>Creating a page that features photo essays and maybe video ones</li>
      </ul>

    </hr>
  <p> I am open to suggestions because to me it feels like a lot and am unsure
     if I am trying to do too much.</p>
